# RPT Process

The "Retention, Promotion, and Tenure" process is an important part of GradSAC's defined duties. 
We review gradute student's feedback about faculty members and make recommendations about their 
retention, promotion, or tenure - hence the name.

## From the University

The faculty review process, often called the Retention, Promotion and Tenure (RPT) process, 
consists of informal and formal reviews conducted at times determined by the department and 
college guidelines. Formal reviews for retention, promotion, and tenure involve an evaluation by 
stakeholders at all levels who provide input regarding the teaching, research, and service of the 
faculty member. 

The student committee is charged with representing students in these formal reviews. When 
complete, the report is included with a candidate’s materials and considered by each level of 
review. We ask that you maintain confidentiality at all times during this process. 
We ask that you do the following: 

1. Attend all trainings before beginning your work.
2. Read carefully the materials from a candidate’s file that are provided to you.
3. Consider the candidate’s contributions in education and mentoring. You can consider 
direct teaching in a classroom as well as the contributions the faculty member makes 
toward curriculum development, educational research, advising, mentoring, and student 
support.
4. Interpret the information concerning student opinion of the faculty member’s teaching 
and mentoring performance. We ask that you present a fair and balanced report of both 
the positive and negative points suggested by the information, which means that you do 
not over- or under- emphasize particular comments but that you present a summary that 
reflects an overall view of a candidate. We also ask that you consider the points raised in 
your training regarding the potential for implicit bias when you consider the information 
that you have been given.
5. Meet as a committee to discuss your results and formulate the final report. Please 
remember to describe and explain any variation in opinion among the members of the 
committee. As with all reports in the RPT process, the report’s persuasiveness will 
depend on its thoroughness as well as the quality and depth of its analysis. The report 
should be signed and dated by the committee members and the chair.

Thank you for your willingness to serve in this important role. The input received from you is an 
important part of the review process and we appreciate the time and effort you spend on this 
endeavor.  

Should you have any questions, please contact your department chair’s or dean’s office.  You 
can also contact the Office for Faculty at 801-581-8763. 

## Our Recommendations

Your assessment should primarily focus on the candidate’s **impact on your constituents** – in this
case, the grad population. For example, are they teaching classes of interest to grads, are they teaching
these classes well, are they reacting to student feedback, do they have a vibrant research program that’s
growing Utah’s reputation, are they good advisors to their Masters and PhD students, are their students
involved in publications and meeting due progress standards, are they involved in service/mentoring that
impacts grads? Don’t expect a candidate to check every one of these criteria. Take a wholistic view, i.e.,
is this candidate a net positive for the grad population and for the school?

Your final report should be roughly three paragraphs long, but can be longer or shorter if needed. When 
reading through documents, here are some things to keep in mind.

- On Teaching + Education:
  - Look over the teaching statement and see if it matches comments from students.
  - What is the feedback on their teaching?
  - How do they interact with their students?
- On Advising + Mentoring:
  - Are they mentoring their students?
  - Are they involved in service?
  - Are their students involved in publications and meeting due progress?
  
Make sure to filter outlier experiences. Many course evaluations have one or two students that significantly 
dislike the course. Did they give valid reasons? Did other students share their complaints? Or were they just 
angry about a poor grade? Write about the general "vibe" of the reports.

## How to RPT

A faculty member will email a list of faculty members who need RPTs and a due date. They'll attach or link
information to review such as course evaluations and teaching statements.

1. **Form a group** of two GradSAC members who do not have a COI with the RPT faculty.
2. **Send a poll** to the faculty's research group asking for info (More on this later)
3. The formed group should **do the RPT**, keeping in mind recommendations from [university](#from-the-university) 
and [us](#our-recommendations)
4. **Fill out the form** "Student Committee Faculty Review Report" with info about what material the RPT was based on
and the RPT report itself
5. **Return the report** to the requesting faculty member before the due date. If this is not possible, email them 
in advance and see [handling short notice requests](#if-rpts-are-requested-on-short-notice)


## If RPTs are requested on short notice

Often, RPTs are requested well after the "required" three weeks notice. If it's not feasible to poll the 
students in the faculty member's research group, that section can be skipped to save time. It's also 
recommended to remind the requester of the university's policies:

- **University of Utah, Policy 6-303, III-C-3**: At least three weeks prior to the closing of the file, the 
department chairperson shall notify the college's ASUU and RPT-SACs of the upcoming review and ensure 
training for all RPT-SAC members. (Effective July 2024)
- **College of Engineering RPT Guidelines, Department Chair Responsibilities, Spring**: No later than the end 
of March, notify the Student Advisory Committee (SAC) Officers and Student Senate Representative of the 
faculty members who will have formal reviews. (Effective January 2017)
- **College of Engineering RPT Guidelines, Student Advisory Committee Responsibilities, Spring and Fall**: 
[paraphrased for brevity] SAC Officers observe faculty candidate in classroom/lab/instructional setting, 
review the candidate's course evaluations, survey students for input, and solicit letters from past students 
advised by the candidate, and submit the signed, written report to the Department Chair at least two weeks 
prior to the RPT File Closing Date.
