# The GradSAC Mailing List

All GradSAC members **must** sign up to recieve emails from the gradsac@cs.utah.edu mailing list. This 
is how faculty members or other grad students get in touch with us. 

Only those who really need to should set up sending ability. For the most part, replying to or sending 
emails from your personal [UMail](https://www.umail.utah.edu/) address is sufficent.

As a "best practice", reply-all on responses to the mailing list. This creates a few extra emails, but 
it ensures we all know what emails have been replied to and questions handled.

## Receiving Emails

To receive emails simply subscribe to the mailing list here. Someone with the admin password will have to confirm the request to subscribe.
