## Skiing and Snowboarding

Enjoy Utah's famous "The Greatest Snow on Earth" with world-renowned skiing and boarding less than an hour from the U of U campus.

In the Cottonwood Canyons to the south of Salt Lake City proper are 

* [Solitude](https://www.solitudemountain.com/) - The most accessible resort, tons of intermediate terrain and some epic stuff in Honeycomb Canyon. 
* [Brighton](https://brightonresort.com/) - The most popular snowboarding resort. Really popular for terrain park lovers.
* [Snowbird](https://www.snowbird.com/) - The most famous and (one of) the most expensive resort. Lives up to the hype. 
* [Alta](https://www.alta.com/) - **Skiers only**. Some of the most technical terrain, but also a ton of beginner terrain. Gets the most snowfall ([903" in 22/23!](https://www.alta.com/stories/rolling-in-the-deep)). A more old-fashioned ski town vibe.

Over in Park City,

* [Deer Valley](https://www.deervalley.com/) - **Skiers only**. Where the celebrities ski. Also a great place to learn.
* [Park City Mountain Resort / Canyons](https://www.parkcitymountain.com/) - Absolutely massive amount of terrain, the only Epic pass resort. Tons of great tree skiing. 

Up north a little ways,

* [Snowbasin](https://www.snowbasin.com/) - Where the 2002 Olympic downhill ski events were held. Golden faucets in the bathrooms.
* [Powder Mountain](https://www.powdermountain.com/) - Largest resort in North America. [Cat skiing](https://www.powdermountain.com/resort/adventures#snowcat). The lodges are at the top.

All of these resorts are world-class you will have a great time at any of them. Each resort sells day passes and season passes. Multi-resort passes are also very popular. 

* [Ikon](https://www.ikonpass.com/) - Unlimited uses to Solitude. Limited days, depending on pass level, to Brighton, Snowbird, Deer Valley, and Snowbasin.
* [Epic](https://www.epicpass.com/) - Unlimited uses to PCMR/Canyons.

Both multi-resort passes get days to resorts outside of Utah, so they are very useful if you intend to travel and ski during the winter. 

### Campus Clubs

There are a few clubs on campus that you can join to give you *significant* discounts on season passes/multi-resort passes. All are fairly similar, so look around and see which fits your vibe and desired pass discount best.

### Rentals and Lessons

The [Outdoor Adventures](https://campusrec.utah.edu/outdoor-adventures/rental/snow/index.php) office provides ski/snowboard rentals at about the best prices you'll find. They also have discounted lift tickets to Solitude and Brighton. 

Brighton offers an [intro package](https://brightonresort.com/snowsports-school-overview/camps-and-workshops/intro-package) of a rental + lift ticket + 2 hour beginner lesson at one of the best prices you'll find. Another great option is Alta's [learn-to-ski](https://www.alta.com/ski-school/adult-camps/learn-to-ski-program) program.
